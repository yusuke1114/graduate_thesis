abstract = {Financial time series forecasting is undoubtedly the top choice of computational intelligence for finance researchers in both academia and the finance industry due to its broad implementation areas and substantial impact. Machine Learning (ML) researchers have created various models, and a vast number of studies have been published accordingly. As such, a significant number of surveys exist covering ML studies on financial time series forecasting. Lately, Deep Learning (DL) models have appeared within the field, with results that significantly outperform their traditional ML counterparts. Even though there is a growing interest in developing models for financial time series forecasting, there is a lack of review papers that solely focus on DL for finance. Hence, the motivation of this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review of DL studies on financial time series forecasting implementation. We not only categorized the studies according to their intended forecasting implementation areas, such as index, forex, and commodity forecasting, but we also grouped them based on their DL model choices, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). We also tried to envision the future of the field by highlighting its possible setbacks and opportunities for the benefit of interested researchers.}

Thanks to a parametrized reward formulation and the use of Deep RL, each group learns a shared policy able to generalize and interpolate over a wide range of behaviors. This is a step towards a fully RL-based market simulator replicating complex market conditions particularly suited to study the dynamics of the financial market under various scenarios.},

abstract = {We consider the learning dynamics of a single reinforcement learning optimal execution trading agent when it interacts with an event-driven agent-based financial market model. Trading takes place asynchronously through a matching engine in event time. The optimal execution agent is considered at different levels of initial order sizes and differently sized state spaces. The resulting impact on the agent-based model and market is considered using a calibration approach that explores changes in the empirical stylised facts and price impact curves. Convergence, volume trajectory and action trace plots are used to visualise the learning dynamics. The smaller state space agents had the number of states they visited converge much faster than the larger state space agents, and they were able to start learning to trade intuitively using the spread and volume states. We find that the moments of the model are robust to the impact of the learning agents, except for the Hurst exponent, which was lowered by the introduction of strategic order-splitting. The introduction of the learning agent preserves the shape of the price impact curves but can reduce the trade-sign auto-correlations and increase the micro-price volatility when the trading volumes increase.}

 abstract = {We report market experiments in which human traders are replaced by "zero-intelligence" programs that submit random bids and offers. Imposing a budget constraint (i.e., not permitting traders to sell below their costs or buy above their values) is sufficient to raise the allocative efficiency of these auctions close to 100 percent. Allocative efficiency of a double auction derives largely from its structure, independent of traders' motivation, intelligence, or learning. Adam Smith's invisible hand may be more powerful than some may have thought; it can generate aggregate rationality not only from individual rationality but also from individual irrationality.},

abstract = {We introduce and study a simple model of a limit order-driven market. Traders in this model can either trade stock (or any other risky asset for that matter) at the market price or place a limit order, i.e., an instruction to buy (sell) a certain amount of the stock if its price falls below (raises above) a predefined level. The choice between these two options is purely random (there are no strategies involved), and the execution price of a limit order is determined simply by offsetting the most recent market price by a random amount. Numerical simulations of this model revealed that despite such minimalistic rules the price pattern generated by this model has such realistic features as “fat” tails of the probability distribution of price fluctuations, characterized by a crossover between two power law exponents, long range correlations of the volatility, and a non-trivial Hurst exponent of the price signal.}

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the distribution of these terms can be used to reveal the presence of trends in the data. We also argue that this distribution can be used as a sensitive tool for identifying weak trends.}

On May 6, 2010, U.S. financial markets experienced a systemic intraday event—the Flash Crash—where a large automated selling program was rapidly executed in the E-mini S\&P 500 stock index futures market. Using audit trail transaction-level data for the E-mini on May 6 and the previous three days, we find that the trading pattern of the most active nondesignated intraday intermediaries (classified as High-Frequency Traders) did not change when prices fell during the Flash Crash.},

The New York Stock Exchange automated quote dissemination in 2003, and we use this change in market structure that increases AT as an exogenous instrument to measure the causal effect of AT on liquidity. For large stocks in particular, AT narrows spreads, reduces adverse selection, and reduces trade-related price discovery. The findings indicate that AT improves liquidity and enhances the informativeness of quotes.},

abstract = {We examine the use of online mechanism design in settings where consumers have multi-unit demand, goods are procured and allocated over time, and future procurement costs are uncertain and only become known at the time of allocation. An important application with such characteristics is demand response, where electricity wholesale prices depend on overall demand and the availability of renewables. We formulate this as a mechanism design problem and focus specifically on the property that the mechanism does not revoke any allocated items. In this setting, we characterise a class of price-based mechanisms that guarantee dominant-strategy incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and no cancellation. We present three specific such mechanisms in this domain and evaluate them in an electric vehicle charging setting. By using extensive numerical simulations, we show that a mechanism based on the first-come first-served principle performs well in settings where future procurement costs can be estimated reliably or supply is very tight, while a responsive mechanism performs very well when the estimated procurement costs are highly uncertain and supply is not as tight. We moreover show that a well-defined price-based mechanism can lead to high profits for the operator of the mechanism in many real-world situations.},

abstract = {This paper describes an artificial immune algorithm (IA) combined with estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), named IA-EDA, for the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Two components are incorporated in IA-EDA to further improve the performance of the conventional IA. First, aiming to strengthen the information exchange during different solutions, two kinds of EDAs involving univariate marginal distribution algorithm and population-based incremental learning are altered based on the permutation representation of TSP. It is expected that new promising candidate solutions can be sampled from the constructed probabilistic model of EDA. Second, a heuristic refinement local search operator is proposed to repair the infeasible solutions sampled by EDA. Therefore, IA-EDA can alleviate the deficiencies of the conventional IA and can find better solutions for TSP by well balancing the exploitation and exploration of the search. Experiments are conducted based on a number of benchmark instances with size up to 100 000 cities. Simulation results show that IA-EDA is effective for improving the performance of the conventional IA and can produce better or competitive solutions than other hybrid algorithms. © 2016 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

We analyze the tradeoffs involved in conditioning pay on long- versus short-term performance and show how manipulation, and investors' uncertainty about it, affects the equilibrium pay contract and the informativeness of prices. Firm and manager characteristics determine the optimal compensation scheme: the strength of incentives, the pay horizon, and the use of options. We consider how corporate governance and disclosure regulations can help create an environment that enables better contracting.},
